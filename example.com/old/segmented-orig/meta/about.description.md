Important:

  * See Caveats for limitations and warnings regarding this data. 
  * Use of this data is subject to multiple terms and conditions. See Terms for details. 

This dataset includes geocoded crime incidents from 1 Jan 2007 to 31 March 2013 that were returned by SANDAG for Public Records request 12-075. 

The extracts from the dataset include both CSV files, for use in spreadsheet applications, and ESRI shapefiles, for use in GIS applications. Both files are partitioned by year and include the following fields. Shapefiles also include point geometries for each incident. 

Many of the columns use [Clarinova Place Codes](https://sandiegodata.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SDD/Clarinova+Place+Codes) (CPC) to identify places, such as neighborhoods, council districts and communities.
