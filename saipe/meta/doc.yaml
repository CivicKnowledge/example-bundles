    summary: Model-based Small Area Income  Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) for School Districts,
        Counties, and States. These estimates combine data from administrative records,
        postcensal population estimates, and the decennial census with direct estimates
        from the American Community Survey to provide consistent and reliable single-year
        estimates. These model-based single-year estimates are more reflective of
        current conditions than multi-year survey estimates.
